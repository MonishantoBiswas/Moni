1. Separate a non-striped and striped frame from a video.
2. Run detection.py on those frames and confirm the result.
3. Create an arduino program that gives out a binary sequence periodically.
4. Create a python program that reads a video, crops ROI and displays striped frames in separate windows.

5. Arithmatic coding compression algorithm to reduce effective data transmission
6. Choose only one vertical column of pixel instead of ROI, plot it and get data from there.
